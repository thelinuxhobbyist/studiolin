# Cloudflare Pages URL Redirect Rules
# This file enforces URL consistency and HTTPS

# 1. Redirect www.studiolinux.com to studiolinux.com (without www)
https://www.studiolinux.com/* https://studiolinux.com/:splat 301

# 2. Redirect removed tutorials to homepage
https://studiolinux.com/tutorials/ https://studiolinux.com/ 301
https://studiolinux.com/tutorials/* https://studiolinux.com/ 301

# 3. Ensure trailing slash consistency for directories
# Note: Hugo naturally adds trailing slashes; this prevents double-slashes
# For any path without extension that doesn't have a trailing slash, add one
# https://:domain/*[!.* ] https://:domain/:1/ 301

# 4. HTTP to HTTPS redirect (usually handled by Cloudflare, but explicit for clarity)
http://studiolinux.com/* https://studiolinux.com/:splat 301
http://www.studiolinux.com/* https://studiolinux.com/:splat 301

# 5. Preserve all other requests as-is
