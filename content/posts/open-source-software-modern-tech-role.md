# The Role of Open-Source Software in Modern Tech

In an era where technology shapes nearly every aspect of life, **open-source software** has quietly but profoundly influenced industries worldwide. No longer just a niche movement, it has become a cornerstone of modern technology, shaping software development, healthcare, government infrastructure, and more.

This article explores how open-source software, particularly Linux, is playing an essential role in shaping the future.

## What is Open-Source Software?

Open-source software is software whose **source code is publicly available** for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. Unlike proprietary software, open-source allows for **community collaboration** and transparency, leading to faster innovation and greater control over digital environments.

**Linux** is one of the most well-known examples of open-source software. It has grown from a small university project into the **backbone of modern infrastructure**, powering everything from smartphones to cloud computing.

## Historical Roots of Open-Source Software

Open-source software began in the early days of computing, when academics freely shared software. Proprietary models emerged in the 1980s, locking code behind licenses.

The modern open-source movement was sparked by **Richard Stallman** and the **Free Software Foundation (FSF)**, which emphasized freely available software. This led to the development of GNU and, later, **Linux**, under Linus Torvalds, which became the most widely adopted open-source OS in the world.
