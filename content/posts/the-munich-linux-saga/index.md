## A City Chooses Freedom

In 2003, Munich's city council made a remarkable decision. It would migrate 15,000 government desktops from Windows to Linux. The project became known as LiMux (Linux in Munich), and it captured international attention as proof that large-scale open-source adoption in government was possible.

But the story doesn't end where you might expect. Over the next 14 years, Munich would face unexpected challenges, achieve measurable successes, make difficult choices, and eventually reverse course. The saga offers lessons that resonate far beyond Munich—and they're increasingly relevant to governments worldwide.

## Successes—and Growing Pains

By 2013, the LiMux project had converted the majority of Munich's systems. The city claimed millions of euros in licensing savings and received international praise as proof that large-scale open-source transitions were possible.

But the journey wasn't without pain points. Employees struggled with compatibility issues, especially when collaborating with organizations still using Microsoft Office. Some public-sector tools were built for Windows only, and change management lagged behind the technical rollout.

It wasn't the software that failed—it was **the system around the software**. The biggest challenge wasn't technical; it was *organizational culture*.

## The Reversal: Back to Windows

In 2017, after years of debate, Munich's leadership voted to migrate back to Microsoft Windows. The decision was framed as a move toward efficiency and standardization, reflecting deeper management and political challenges.

For many in the open-source community, it felt like a setback. But it also offered a valuable reality check: adopting Linux in government isn't just about installing a new operating system—it's about transforming how public institutions think about technology, collaboration, and ownership.

## The Legacy of LiMux: Lessons for the Future

Today, Munich and many other public institutions are again exploring open-source solutions and hybrid systems. Across Europe, governments are rethinking dependency on proprietary software and promoting "open source first" strategies.

Key takeaways from the LiMux saga:

1. **Change management is key.**  
   You can't just switch software—you have to bring people along for the journey.

2. **Digital sovereignty takes persistence.**  
   True independence from vendors is a long-term cultural shift, not a one-off migration.

3. **Hybrid approaches can bridge the gap.**  
   Open-source foundations combined with pragmatic interoperability often ease transitions.

4. **Open source is about community.**  
   Success depends on collaboration between IT teams, educators, governments, and citizens.

## Why Munich Still Matters

The Munich Linux saga isn't a failure story—it's a learning story. Every step toward open-source adoption, even the difficult ones, contributes to a broader movement toward **freedom, transparency, and empowerment in technology**.

As schools, cities, and public institutions continue exploring Linux and open tools, they stand on the shoulders of pioneers like Munich—who dared to imagine a world where public software serves the public good.
