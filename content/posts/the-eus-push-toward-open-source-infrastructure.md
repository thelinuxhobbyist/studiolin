description: "How European institutions are shifting public services to open-source software for sovereignty, cost, and privacy."

When officials in Brussels talk about “digital sovereignty,” it can sound like one of those lofty political phrases that drift through speeches without ever touching the ground. But in recent years, the phrase has acquired a very concrete meaning inside European institutions, where something unusual is happening behind the scenes: governments are quietly rewriting the technological foundations of their public services, and they are increasingly doing it on open-source software.

It is a shift that has taken shape slowly, almost cautiously, but it is now gathering momentum across Europe. In ministries, schools, universities, and national agencies, Linux-based platforms and open-source tools are replacing decades-old proprietary systems. What might once have been dismissed as a hobbyist movement, or the preference of a few idealistic IT departments, has become a deliberate political strategy. And in typical European fashion, the reasons are not just technical—they are political, economic, and ideological.

For years, Europe has relied heavily on a small group of American technology giants to run everything from government email servers to education platforms. That reliance was tolerated, even welcomed, when digital tools were simply conveniences. But as software became infrastructure—something as essential as electricity or roads—the dependence began to look less like practicality and more like vulnerability. European policymakers started asking uncomfortable questions: Who controls the data of millions of EU citizens? Who sets the rules for how public-sector software works? What happens if a private company changes its prices, its policies, or its entire structure?

The answers to those questions increasingly pointed toward the same solution: open-source systems that Europe could inspect, modify, and govern independently.

Inside the European Commission, this thinking became institutional with the creation of the Open Source Program Office, a department few outside Brussels have heard of but one that signals a strategic change. Its mandate is simple enough—coordinate open-source use across EU institutions, encourage code-sharing between member states, and ensure that tools funded by public money can be reused rather than locked away. But behind that simplicity is a broader ambition: to give Europe its own technological backbone, free from foreign control.

This shift is not just a response to political anxieties. It is also the result of rising costs. The price of proprietary licensing has quietly climbed for years, straining public budgets and frustrating IT departments. Many governments now find themselves paying more each year for the same set of tools, trapped in ecosystems that have no meaningful competitive alternatives. Open-source platforms offer a way out: lower long-term costs, no vendor lock-in, and software that can be adapted rather than accepted as-is.

The classroom has become one of the most visible fronts in this transformation. Across Europe, the question of student data privacy has sparked heated debate. Several countries have pushed back against the widespread use of closed cloud platforms in schools, arguing that educational institutions should not be required to hand over data on millions of minors to foreign technology companies. Some regions in Germany have already moved to restrict or phase out certain proprietary services; French and Dutch authorities have raised similar concerns.

What has emerged in their place is a growing ecosystem of Linux-based systems, open-source learning platforms, and self-hosted digital classrooms. Teachers in parts of Europe are increasingly using tools like Moodle or Nextcloud rather than the big commercial suites. Computer labs are running Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. Raspberry Pi devices—cheap, open, and highly educational—have become a staple of many digital literacy programs. For schools already under financial pressure, the economics are compelling. For governments concerned with sovereignty and privacy, the benefits are even clearer.

The change is happening within government ministries too. In some countries, entire departments are now running exclusively on Linux. Not because of ideology, but because the old proprietary systems could no longer meet modern needs without massive costs and compromises. In France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the Nordic countries, there are countless examples of agencies abandoning closed platforms in favour of open-source alternatives. These migrations are not always smooth—compatibility issues and staff training can slow progress—but the direction is remarkably consistent.

What is striking is how this movement mirrors Europe’s broader regulatory approach. Just as the GDPR reshaped global privacy norms, the EU’s embrace of open-source infrastructure may end up influencing digital policy far beyond its borders. Countries in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia—regions that rely heavily on external tech companies—are watching closely. If Europe demonstrates that large-scale public services can run securely and effectively on open technologies, others may replicate the model.

Europe’s push is also reshaping the technology sector within the continent. Local companies that specialise in open-source systems are seeing new demand. Universities are adjusting their curricula to place greater emphasis on Linux and open-source development. Startups are emerging to build tools that compete with long-standing proprietary products but with European privacy standards built into their architecture. For students and young developers entering the field today, Linux skills are not just useful—they are increasingly essential.

Of course, not everyone is convinced. Some critics argue that the private sector’s dominance exists for a reason: proprietary tools are polished, convenient, and often deeply integrated with one another. They warn that switching to open systems may introduce friction that governments and schools are not prepared to manage. Others worry that Europe may underestimate the cost and complexity of maintaining its own digital infrastructure over the long term.

But in conversations with policymakers and digital architects across Europe, the sentiment is remarkably consistent. Convenience is no longer enough. The stakes are too high. As one senior official put it in a parliamentary committee session, “The question is not whether open-source infrastructure is perfect. It is whether dependence is acceptable.”

That line captures the mood shaping Europe’s new strategy. This is not a romantic return to the early ideals of the internet. It is a pragmatic response to the realities of power in a digital age. Europe does not want to be cut off from the innovations of global tech companies. But it no longer wants the foundations of its public services to depend entirely on them, either.

Whether Europe’s vision succeeds depends on factors still unfolding. Migrating millions of users across dozens of countries is a long, difficult process. Building competitive open-source services requires investment and expertise. And cultural habits—formed over decades of using familiar proprietary tools—do not change overnight.

But the direction is unmistakable. Open-source software is no longer a fringe idea in European governance. It is becoming part of the continent’s political identity: transparent, collaborative, and built on the belief that essential public infrastructure should serve the public first.

If the 20th century was shaped by the question of who controlled a nation’s land and industry, the 21st may well be shaped by who controls its software. And in this quiet but far-reaching transition, Europe is trying to ensure that the answer, at last, is itself.
