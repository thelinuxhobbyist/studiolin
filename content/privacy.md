### Introduction

At Studio Linux, your privacy matters.
This website shares stories and ideas about open-source software, but we don’t collect personal data, create accounts, or ask for sign-ups. Our goal is to inform — not to track.

We do, however, use a few standard analytics tools to understand how visitors interact with the site so we can make it better.

### What’s Collected (and What’s Not)

We don’t ask for names, logins, or emails.
When you visit studiolinux.com, a few services automatically collect basic technical data — like browser type, device, and pages viewed — the same as nearly every website today.

Those services are:

- Google Analytics — to understand which articles are read most often.
- Cloudflare — to secure the site and protect against spam or attacks.

These tools may set cookies, but all data is aggregated and anonymized. We don’t sell, share, or monetize any of it.

### How We Use This Information

We use analytics to:

- See what content readers enjoy most,
- Fix performance issues,
- Keep the site fast and secure.

That’s it. No advertising IDs, no profiling, no mailing lists.

### Third-Party Links

Studio Linux occasionally links to other websites — especially open-source projects and documentation. Once you follow those links, their privacy policies apply, not ours.

### Your Options

If you prefer not to be tracked at all:

- Use a browser’s Do Not Track feature,
- Block cookies or scripts for analytics,
- Or use privacy extensions like uBlock or Privacy Badger.

Our content remains fully accessible either way.

### Changes

If we add new features (like comments or a newsletter), this policy will be updated before any personal data is collected.
