Studio Linux is an editorial website about Linux, open-source software, and their growing role in government, education, and public institutions. This site is designed to be read without accounts, logins, or sign-ups.

We do not ask for personal details such as names or email addresses, and we do not maintain user profiles or mailing lists. Our intention is to publish information, not to track individuals.

Like most websites, StudioLinux.com relies on a small number of third-party services to operate reliably, understand general readership patterns, and help cover basic operating costs.

When you visit the site, limited technical information may be collected automatically by these services. This can include your browser type, device type, approximate geographic region, and which pages are viewed. This data is processed in an aggregated and non-personal way.

We currently use Google Analytics to understand which articles are read and how visitors navigate the site. Cloudflare is used to provide security, performance improvements, and protection against malicious traffic. Studio Linux may also display advertising supplied by Google AdSense, either now or in the future.

Advertising provided by Google AdSense may use cookies, including the DoubleClick cookie, to display ads that are relevant based on visits to this and other websites. Google's use of data from sites that use its services is explained here:

If you prefer not to see personalized advertising, you can manage or opt out of ad personalization through Google's ad settings at:
https://adssettings.google.com

The information collected through analytics and advertising services is used only to understand how the site is used, improve performance and reliability, maintain security, and support the site through advertising. Studio Linux does not sell personal data or share it for marketing purposes.

Articles on Studio Linux may link to external websites, such as Linux distributions, open-source projects, or documentation resources. Once you leave this site, the privacy practices of those websites apply.

If you prefer to limit tracking, you may enable "Do Not Track" in your browser, block cookies, or use privacy-focused browser extensions. All content on Studio Linux remains accessible even if cookies or advertising are blocked.

If new features are introduced in the future — such as comments, newsletters, or user accounts — this privacy policy will be updated before any additional data collection takes place.
