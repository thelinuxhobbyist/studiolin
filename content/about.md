# About StudioLinux

StudioLinux is an independent editorial project dedicated to exploring how Linux and open-source software are transforming the world — from governments and education to enterprise technology and everyday computing.

Our mission is to make Linux accessible and relevant beyond the terminal. Through in-depth articles, analysis, and practical guides, StudioLinux examines the real-world impact of open-source software on public infrastructure, digital sovereignty, privacy, and innovation.

We focus on clarity over hype. Rather than chasing trends or market share debates, StudioLinux explains not only how Linux works, but why it matters — for institutions, professionals, and individuals alike.

## Who Runs StudioLinux

StudioLinux is founded, edited, and operated by Neil Cass, a software engineer with over 20 years of experience working with Linux and open-source systems. He uses Linux daily in both professional and personal environments, with hands-on experience across infrastructure, enterprise systems, and real-world deployments.

All content published on StudioLinux is written and reviewed with an emphasis on technical accuracy, practical relevance, and long-term value.

All articles are:
