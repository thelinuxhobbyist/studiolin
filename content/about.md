# About StudioLinux

StudioLinux.com is an independent editorial project dedicated to exploring how Linux and open-source software are transforming the world — from governments and education to enterprise technology and everyday computing.

Our mission is to make Linux accessible and relevant beyond the terminal. Through in-depth articles, analysis, and practical guides, we examine the real-world impact of open-source software on public infrastructure, digital sovereignty, privacy, and innovation.

StudioLinux focuses on clarity over hype. We aim to explain not just how Linux works, but why it matters — for institutions, professionals, and individuals alike.

## Editorial Responsibility & Approach

- **Based on real-world use, industry practice, and public documentation**
- **Intended to inform rather than promote products or vendors**
- **Supported by official documentation, public reports, and primary sources** where appropriate to support analysis and factual claims

StudioLinux does not accept sponsored content or paid endorsements. Editorial decisions are made independently to ensure objective, trustworthy coverage.
