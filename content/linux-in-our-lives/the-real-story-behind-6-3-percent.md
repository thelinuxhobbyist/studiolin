Trying to figure out how many people use Linux on their desktop is always a pain. When we talk about servers, Linux is the undisputed king—running everything from the cloud to the world's fastest supercomputers. But on the desktop? That footprint has historically been elusive, hidden behind shaky analytics, limited surveys, and a lot of guesswork.

That's why, every year, a deeply unexpected dataset becomes the subject of serious industry discussion: Pornhub's Year in Review. Yes, you read that right. Despite its subject matter, this annual report is actually a rare piece of gold for analysts. Why? Because almost no other global platform is big enough—or transparent enough—to release detailed, large-scale device and operating-system statistics based on hundreds of millions of daily visits.

For anyone who cares about Linux's desktop trajectory, this report is invaluable. And the numbers in the 2025 report demand attention: Linux pulled in 6.3% of desktop traffic, marking a stunning 22% growth year-over-year.

But that number isn't the whole story. In fact, it's just the tip of the iceberg.

## Why We Use This Controversial Data

Before we dive into the data, a quick point of order: We are analyzing the operating system data only. The reason this report matters isn't the content on the site; it's the sheer size and global reach of the traffic.

When one of the few companies with truly massive, cross-platform usage decides to open its analytics, the Linux community needs to pay attention.

## The 6% Is Not Linux's "Market Share"

It's easy to look at that 6.3% and declare that's how many people use Linux globally. That would be a massive mistake. This is not a global census. It's a traffic snapshot, and millions of active Linux users are completely absent from this data set.

Think about the users who never show up here:

**Corporate and Research:** Enterprise workstations, government systems, and internal research desktops rarely access general consumer web traffic.

**Education:** University and STEM program computer labs, which often run Linux, usually have heavily restricted browsing policies.

**The Power Users:** Developers, sysadmins, and DevOps professionals spend their workdays buried in terminals and internal cloud dashboards, not general entertainment browsing.

**The Privacy Crowd:** Linux users are naturally highly privacy-focused. They disproportionately run aggressive tracking blockers (uBlock, Pi-Hole, VPNs) that actively avoid being counted by public analytics platforms.

The simple truth is this dataset captures only one slice of behavior. Linux shows up strongly in that slice, but it represents merely a fraction of the actual user base.

## The Problem: Big Tech Doesn't Share Analytics

What makes this data so critical is the silence from every other major platform.

We live in a world where the companies with the most complete, global analytics—Google, Meta/Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Netflix, and Amazon—give the public zero insight into what operating systems their users run.

So, when a massive, annual report does provide OS-level share, it instantly becomes one of the only windows we have into real-world device distribution. It's not a perfect window, but it's the only one available.

## The Latest Numbers: A Steep Trajectory

Here's the breakdown from the 2025 report:

| Operating System | Share | Year-over-Year Change |
|------------------|-------|----------------------|
| Windows          | 70.5% | Down                |
| macOS            | 20.3% | Slightly Up          |
| Linux            | 6.3%  | Up 22.4%             |
| ChromeOS         | 2.4%  | Down 7.1%            |

There are several major takeaways here that should fundamentally challenge the old "Linux is only 2%" narrative:

**Fastest Growth:** Linux is the fastest-growing desktop OS in the dataset, period. A 22% increase in a single year isn't a fluke; it's a significant trend.

**ChromeOS vs. Linux:** While Linux is surging, ChromeOS is shrinking. This points to users "graduating" from the simplified Chrome environment and adopting full Linux distributions.

## Why Is Linux Suddenly So Visible?

The desktop Linux environment has been quietly undergoing a revolution, and the traffic data is finally catching up.

**The Desktop Experience is Excellent:** Distributions like Fedora, Pop!_OS, Mint, and Ubuntu now offer a polished, hassle-free daily driver experience.

**The Steam Deck Effect:** Valve's Steam Deck has been a phenomenal, quiet onboarding ramp for millions of new Linux users.

**Hardware No Longer Fights Back:** You can now buy fully supported Linux laptops off-the-shelf from major players like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and specialized vendors like System76 and Framework. The era of wrestling with drivers is largely over.

## The Final Takeaway: The Visibility Trend

The argument is simple: Wherever the numbers are published, Linux is appearing in higher numbers and growing faster than the competition.

You don't have to believe the 6.3% is the absolute total. You just have to acknowledge the trend it reveals: Linux is growing, and it's growing steeply.

The growth narrative for Linux isn't about one number; it's about ecosystems: Steam Deck for gaming, WSL for developers, Flatpak for software distribution, and OEM partners for hardware. The 6% is merely a measurable symptom of a much larger shift.

Linux isn't taking over the world overnight, but its presence is becoming visible everywhere it counts. And that's a story worth tracking.
