When schools talk about budget shortfalls, the conversation usually turns to staffing, buildings, or class sizes. Less visible—but just as expensive—is the software quietly draining education budgets year after year.

Operating systems. Office suites. Specialist tools. Learning platforms.

None of them cheap, and none of them optional.

Across the UK, schools and universities are spending millions annually just to keep software licenses active. And increasingly, IT departments are asking an uncomfortable question: what if we didn't have to?

## Software Licenses: The Hidden Line Item

From Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) to Russell Group universities, proprietary software licensing has become a structural cost rather than a one-off purchase. Subscription-based models mean institutions don't "own" their tools—they rent them indefinitely.

The knock-on effects go beyond licensing fees. Major software updates often force hardware upgrades, pushing schools into refresh cycles that have little to do with educational need and everything to do with compatibility.

For underfunded institutions, this creates a familiar pattern: money locked into software maintenance instead of teaching resources.

## Cutting Costs Without Cutting Capability

The most immediate alternative is also the simplest: remove licensing costs entirely.

Linux-based operating systems such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Linux Mint are increasingly being deployed in educational environments. They're free, well-supported, and—crucially—run well on older hardware.

That matters. Machines that might otherwise be retired can remain in service for years, reducing both capital expenditure and e-waste.

Productivity software follows the same pattern. LibreOffice replaces subscription-based office suites with a full-featured, standards-compliant alternative. On the server side, tools like Apache, MariaDB, and Moodle provide robust infrastructure without vendor lock-in.

For IT teams, the benefits are practical as much as financial. Fewer licensing constraints mean more flexibility—and fewer conversations about compliance instead of education.

## Control, Transparency, and the Ethics of Software

Cost savings are only part of the story.

Schools handle sensitive student data, making privacy and regulatory compliance non-negotiable. Hosting services on Linux-based infrastructure gives institutions direct control over where data lives and how it's managed—an increasingly important consideration under GDPR.

Open-source software also changes how technology is taught. Instead of treating software as a sealed product, students can examine real systems, read real code, and understand how tools actually work.

In computing courses especially, this aligns closely with curriculum goals focused on problem-solving and system-level understanding.

As one UK network manager put it:

> "Money spent promoting specific proprietary software could be better spent on teachers and actual education."

## "Free" Doesn't Always Mean Open — and That's OK

Not all cost savings come from open-source projects.

In creative and specialist disciplines, tools like Affinity and Canva have disrupted long-standing pricing models by offering professional-grade software without recurring fees. While not open source, they remove financial barriers that previously limited access to design tools.

There's an important distinction here:

- **Open-source software** offers control and transparency.
- **Free-to-use tools** offer immediate financial relief.

Both approaches reduce dependency on expensive licensing models—and both are reshaping what schools can realistically afford.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

At Westcliff High School for Girls Academy, a large-scale migration to Linux allowed hundreds of student machines to remain in service. Hardware lifespans were extended, costs reduced, and systems aligned more closely with the computing curriculum.

For Multi-Academy Trusts, the impact can be even greater. Standardising on open-source platforms across multiple schools enables:

- Centralised IT management
- Shared training and resources
- Significant cost reductions at scale

What begins as a technical decision quickly becomes an organisational one.

## A Quieter Future for Ed-Tech Spending

The current software licensing model in education is expensive, rigid, and increasingly difficult to justify. Open-source platforms—and a growing ecosystem of free tools—offer a different path.

Not a radical overhaul. Not a compromise on quality. Just fewer invoices for software that schools never truly owned.

As Affinity's CEO put it:

> "Creativity shouldn't be gated."

In education, neither should access to the tools that make learning possible.
