Governments around the world are increasingly turning to Linux for their IT infrastructure. This shift is driven by the need for greater digital sovereignty, enhanced security, and significant cost reductions.

## Digital Sovereignty

By using open-source software like Linux, governments can avoid vendor lock-in and maintain control over their digital infrastructure. This is particularly important in an era of increasing cyber threats.

## Security Advantages

Linux's robust security features, combined with regular updates from the open-source community, make it an ideal choice for government applications where data protection is paramount.

## Case Studies

Cities like Munich and agencies such as the French Gendarmerie have successfully migrated to Linux, demonstrating its viability for large-scale government operations.
